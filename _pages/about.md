I begin to pursue my Ph.D. degree in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) from Sept. 2023, where I am advised by [Prof. Kai Yu](https://scholar.google.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=APssqUMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Before that, I received my M.S. degree from Tongji University in 2023, and B.S. degree from Shanghai University in 2020.
My research interests include LLM and its application in Science(AI4S), especially Chemistry.
